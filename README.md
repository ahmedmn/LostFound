Everyone knows the sinking feeling of realizing they have lost something. For this need we will create a web portal to solve this problem. Users can post items Lost/Found in the web portal and the other people can see this posts and return the lost items to their owners. Items are categorized in to many parts like Technology, People, Money, Cloths, Accessories, Transportations (Car, Bike), and others...
